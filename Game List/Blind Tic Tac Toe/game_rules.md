# Overview

The objective of the game "Blind Tic-Tac-Toe" is to create a sequence of four cards of the same symbol vertically or horizontally using the 4x4 grid. When a player believes they have created this sequence, they must declare victory and turn over the cards to prove it. The other player can contest the declaration and, if correct, wins the game.

To play, you need 54 playing cards, three X cards with an eye design, three O cards with an eye design, four wild cards, 22 X cards, and 22 O cards, as well as one X pawn and one O pawn.

To begin, shuffle the cards and distribute them on a flat surface forming a 4x4 grid with 16 cards. Each player must draw five cards. The pawns must be placed on a diagonal of the grid.

Upon starting the game, each player must follow the following sequence of steps on their turn:

1. Optional phase: the player can check the card under their pawn.
2. Movement phase: the player can move the pawn one space vertically or horizontally at a time, check what the card is, and turn it face down. The player can opt not to move to change the card in the position they were previously in.
3. Action phase: the player chooses any card of their preference from their hand and replaces it with the card under the pawn, turning it face down. The player plays their cards during the game and when they run out of cards, they must draw five more. The discarded cards, as well as the cards that were on the grid and were replaced, form a new deck that will be used if the draw deck runs out.

Attention: if a player is on a card with an eye drawn on it, they can quickly see a card of their choice on the grid by discarding the card and replacing it with one from their hand.
