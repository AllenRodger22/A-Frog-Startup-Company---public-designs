# **Do not steal my carrot!(WIP)**

By Alan Roger

# **Preparation of the game:**

- Shuffle all 52 cards into one set, which will be the market.
- Initial purchase: each player must draw 5 cards from the market and hide 2 of their choice in their warehouse. The remaining 3 cards are left on the table exposed and form the player's restaurant set.

# **Start of the round:**

- Choice of the initial player: Always start with the youngest player and follow clockwise.
- The current player must choose one of the following actions:
    - Go to the market: Draw a card from the market and add it to your restaurant set.
    - Steal ingredient: Choose a card from another player's restaurant set and add it to your own restaurant set. It is not allowed to steal cards from other player's warehouses, nor to put a stolen card directly in the warehouse. This would cost another action.
    - Sell ingredient: Return a card from your restaurant set to the market. It is not allowed to leave the restaurant set with less than the lower limit of 3 cards. Your restaurant set can only have less than 3 cards if you are stolen by another player.
    - Trade ingredients: Choose a card from your restaurant set and offer it to another player in exchange for one of their cards. The trade is only valid if the other player accepts. It is not possible to trade cards from the warehouse.
    - Cook something: You can cook something immediately after stealing or going to the market, using the new card in the recipe. If the cards in the restaurant set and warehouse can reach a recipe requirement, the player can opt to make the recipe by combining the necessary cards and placing them in a part of the table where no one will interfere until the end of the game. The recipes will count for points at the end of the game. If the set of recipe items uses cards from the warehouse and restaurant set, and the restaurant set ends up with less than 3 cards, this is allowed. If your warehouse ends up with less than 2 cards, you can put cards from your restaurant set into your warehouse if you wish. Your restaurant set is allowed to have more than 3 cards.
    - Swap warehouse item: Choose a card from your restaurant set and swap it for one from your warehouse.
