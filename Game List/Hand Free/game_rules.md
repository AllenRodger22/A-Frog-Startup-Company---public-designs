### **Components:**

- A standard 52-card deck with 4 suits (spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs).

### **Objective:**

- Be the first player to get rid of all of your cards.

### **Setup:**

- Shuffle the deck and deal an equal number of cards to each player. (Only a pair amount of players are allowed)

### **Gameplay:**

- On your turn, choose one card from your hand and play it face-down on the table.
- Once all players have played a card, turn them face up.
- The player with the highest card value wins the round and collects all of the cards that have been played.
- If two or more players tie for the highest card value, the cards are splitted to them.
- The game ends when one player has no cards left, and that player is the winner.
