### Rules
Shuffle the 52-card deck.
Each player draws 2 cards at the beginning of the game.
The game is played in turns, moving counterclockwise.
Each player keeps their cards hidden and chooses one card to play.
All players play their chosen cards face down, and then turn them face up when everyone has played.
The highest ranking card wins, with the ranking order as follows: 
## A > K > Q > J > 10 > 9 > 8 > 7 > 6 > 5 > 4 > 3 > 2.
All players discard their cards, except for the player who won the round. This player does not need to draw any cards in this turn.
If a player only has one card and plays it, and loses the round, they must draw 2 cards instead of just one.
The maximum number of cards a player can have in their hand is 2.
Who reach 0 cards in hand first, wins!
