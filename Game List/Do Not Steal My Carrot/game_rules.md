# Preparation of the game:

- Shuffle all 52 cards into one set, which will be the market.
- Initial purchase: each player must draw 5 cards from the market and hide 2 of their choice in their warehouse, the remaining 3 are left on the table exposed, these 3 form the restaurant set.

# Start of the round:

- Choice of the initial player: Always start with the youngest player and follow clockwise
- The current player must choose one of the following actions:
    - Go to the market: draw a card from the market and put it in your restaurant (Action blocked if the restaurant reaches its limit of 5 cards in the set)
    - Steal ingredient: choose a card from another player's restaurant and put it in your own restaurant. It is not allowed to steal cards from other player's warehouses, nor to put a stolen card directly in the warehouse, as this would cost another action.
    - Sell ingredient: return a card from your restaurant to the market. It is not allowed to leave the restaurant with less than the lower limit of 2 cards, your restaurant can only have less than 2 cards if you are stolen by someone)
    - Trade ingredients: choose a card from your restaurant and offer it to another player in exchange for one of their cards. The trade is only valid if the other player accepts, and it is not possible to trade cards from the warehouse.
    - Make recipe: When the cards in the restaurant + warehouse can form a recipe, the player can opt to make the recipe, combining the necessary cards and placing them in a part of the table where no one will interfere until the end of the game, where the recipes will count the points. If the set of recipe items uses cards from the warehouse + restaurant, and the restaurant ends up with less than 2 cards, this is allowed. If your warehouse ends up with less than 2 cards, you can put cards from your restaurant in your warehouse if you wish.
    - Swap warehouse item: choose a card from your restaurant and swap it for one from your warehouse.
