## **Components**

- Old Maid deck (52 cards with 4 suits)

## **Objective**

- Create a String (sequence) of 5 cards of the same suit, such as 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 10, J, Q, K, A, or even A, K, Q, J, 10, on the discard piles.

## **Setup**

- Each player draws 3 cards from the shuffled deck.
- Place 3 random cards side by side to create the player piles, which will be used to build the String.

## **Gameplay**

- On a player's turn, they draw a card from the draw pile and place it in one of the 5 spaces (the player piles).
- The turn then ends and play continues in a counterclockwise direction.
- Players take turns until someone creates a String.

## **Winning the game**

- The first player to create a String wins the game.
